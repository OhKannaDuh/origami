Shiba Artist School [Artisan]
Renowned throughout Rokugan for their deeply spir-
itual works of art, the Phoenix Clan’s Shiba Artists are
highly sought after for festivals and special events,
including the Winter Court. Artists expertly perform
soulfully crafted song and verse to enthrall onlookers,
create unique works of clay or stone for their hosts, or
even forge armor before enraptured crowds. What-
ever their art, Shiba Artists always make the act of cre-
ation a part of the work itself, whether it takes fleeting
moments or days of labor. Most Shiba Artists train in
a wide range of artistic forms, and they use each new
lesson they learn to inspire them in their next endeavor.
