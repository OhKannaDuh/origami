Kitsu Medic School [Artisan, Bushi]
Though the Kitsu family is known more for its shugen-
ja samurai, the students of the Kitsu Medic School are
also of note. They are skilled in the martial arts, but
their primary vocation is healing. As such, they are an
important part of any Lion army going into battle. The
warrior skills of Kitsu Medics mean they can be at the
forefront of the fighting, killing foes as well as tending
to their clan’s wounded.
