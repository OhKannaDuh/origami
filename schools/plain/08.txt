Shika Speardancer School
[Bushi, Shinobi]
Shika Speardancers are yōjimbō and shinobi, but to
the outside world, they are simply seen as messen-
gers, known well for their swiftness and neutrality. They
deliver urgent or romantic missives to both dignitaries
and lovers throughout Rokugan. The Deer Clan directs
its Speardancers to monitor targets deemed crucial
to maintaining or restoring balance in Rokugan. Their
cover as couriers frees them to work as bodyguards
or assassins without drawing attention. Speardancers
exude fierce independence and tenacity. These wild
warriors focus on becoming an extension of their yari,
practicing a unique set of kata that combine dizzying
spins, lightning-speed twirls, and deadly accuracy.
