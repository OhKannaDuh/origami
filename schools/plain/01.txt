Asako Inquisitor School
[Courtier, Shugenja]
Unlike the horrors of the Shadowlands, mahō can arise
anywhere and can exist in any location as a hidden cor-
ruption. To root out and combat this, the Asako Inquis-
itors were formed in the third century. Originally, they
concentrated on their own clan, to purge the Phoenix of
any who would engage in such foul practices, but over
time, their remit widened to include all of the Emerald
Empire. This has brought Asako Inquisitors, who answer
only to their clan’s Council of Five and the Emperor, into
conflict at times with people of the Kuni Purifier School.
