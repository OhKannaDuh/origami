Bayushi Deathdealer School
[Bushi, Shinobi]
The school of warriors Bayushi founded trains under
the principle that it is always better to be underesti-
mated. Its doors are open to any aspirant who can sur-
vive its rigors, but its secrets are concealed to those
who are not cunning and inventive enough to uncover
them. Its curriculum includes the bow, the sword, and
subtler weapons still. The school also teaches iaijutsu—
but students are always reminded that it is merely a
tool of power like any other. Every tool has its proper
place and proper uses, and the Bayushi Deathdealer
school gives its students the widest arsenal available.
