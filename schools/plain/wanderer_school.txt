Kitsu Realm Wanderer School
[Shugenja, Bushi]
Member’s of the Lion Clan’s Kitsu family have a unique
connection to the Spirit Realms due to their heritage and
their position as conduits for their kitsu ancestors. Because
of this near-constant connection, some Kitsu have the
innate ability to call upon the ties that bind the realms
and bid them move closer, creating places of power that
overlap with the Mortal Realm. In this way, these Kitsu
Realm Wanderers can seek wisdom and the secrets of the
realms. However, doing so may bring unwanted atten-
tion, particularly from the ravenous baku.
