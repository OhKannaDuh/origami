Shika Matchmaker School
[Courtier, Shugenja]
Shika Matchmakers are shugenja guided by Musubi,
the secretive Fortune who binds together the fates of
people. While they are skilled in the art of invocation,
their greatest power is their ability to see the bonds
people form—with other people and with destiny. A
practitioner of Musubu can sense the future results of
fortuitous or inopportune matches, and they use this
information to serve the Deer Clan’s goal of achieving a
balanced world. Although most of their matches prove
successful for all involved, occasionally a couple’s hap-
piness must be sacrificed for some greater goal.

CHAPTER 2: WARS OF WORDS AND SHADOWS
MATCHMAKING IN
ROKUGAN
Shika Matchmakers are
hardly the only match-
makers in Rokugan—
while they possess unique
abilities, the job is done
by many people, and the
process has certain simi-
larities in many parts of
Rokugan. A matchmaker,
or nakōdo, meets with
noble patrons who seek
guidance in forming
familial, financial,
political, or romantic
relationships. Using a
method of introduction
called hashikake, the
matchmaker hosts
meetings to determine
the strength of a pairing.
If the exchange goes
smoothly, the matchmaker
plays the role of mediator,
eventually stepping back
to monitor the relation-
ship from afar.ADVANCE TYPE

Curse of Musubi-no-Kami (Mastery Ability):
Once per scene, after successfully perform-
ing the Ties that Bind ritual, you may spend
1 Void point to catch a glimpse of all major
future consequences of the relationship iden-
tified by the ritual. You also learn of one other
relationship between your target and another
character that will guarantee that the conse-
quences you predict will not come to pass.
