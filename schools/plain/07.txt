Toritaka Phantom Hunter
School [Shugenja]
From the days of the Falcon Clan founder, Toritaka
Yotogi, Toritaka Phantom Hunters have sought out gaki
and other malign supernatural beings, a task that is
often unfortunately easy, given the clan’s proximity to
the haunted Shinomen Forest and the corrupted Shad-
owlands. Phantom Hunters often act in concert with
Crab Clan warriors, using their legendary abilities to
detect supernatural threats that others, even the skilled
bushi stationed on the Wall, cannot perceive.
