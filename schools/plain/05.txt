Mercenary Ninja Training [Shinobi]
Without family, honor, or remorse, Mercenary Ninja
move without a trace to ply their lethal trade in search
of fortune. Consisting of highly skilled commoners and
former Great Clan shinobi, they exist as disposable
and deniable assets lying in wait among the shadows
of Rokugan. Daimyō and nobles purchase the loyalty
of Mercenary Ninja to have them kill and steal with
ruthless efficiency—for unlike shinobi who serve the
Great Clans, they serve only their own interests.
When not otherwise engaged, Mercenary Ninja
generally live simple lives. No formal schools exist for
such lawless individuals, but some Mercenary Ninja train
under a mentor, while others create their own cadres.
