Mirumoto Taoist Blade
School [Bushi, Monk]
As the name suggests, the monks of the Mirumoto Tao-
ist Blade School make study of swordplay an integral
part of their quest for Enlightenment. Such are their
skills that their blades act as if part of their bodies, strik-
ing as easily as fists would do for others. Their isolated
monastery and dōjō is nestled deep within northern
mountains within Dragon lands, and it is extraordinarily
rare for them to host visitors. Most Rokugani who wit-
ness their skills do so when one of these monks departs
to walk the Emerald Empire in search of new insights
and possibly even new lessons in the blade.
