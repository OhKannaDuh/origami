Kuni Warden School [Monk]
A number of Kuni who lack the aptitude to become
shugenja are trained in the tradition of the Kuni War-
dens. These grim monks maintain the Barracks of the
Damned, a massive hospital, laboratory, and prison
that is also their temple. Experts at subduing Tainted
humans and overcoming sorcery, even without weap-
ons, many serve at or near the Wall, but some War-
dens occasionally make their way into the wider world.
The order sometimes sends its agents to “tend to the
spiritual needs” of those who have been exposed to
the corruption of Fu Leng. This can include offering the
mercy of death, should their charge be fully consumed
by the Taint.
