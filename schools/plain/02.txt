Kakita Swordsmith School
[Artisan, Courtier]
Like all institutions of the Crane, the Kakita Swordsmith
School emphasizes perfection and excellence. The
blades they forge are renowned across Rokugan as the
finest that can be made; some duelists wait long years
for the opportunity to have one of these blades crafted
for their use. Very rarely, a venerable swordsmith will
take on a promising youth as an apprentice, though
most apprentices spend decades before they are hon-
ored as “proficient.”
