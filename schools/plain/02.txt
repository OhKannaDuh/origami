Daidoji Spymaster School
[Courtier, Shinobi]
Seen as nothing more than simple bureaucrats, clerks,
or scribes (even to most members of their own clan),
the Daidoji Spymasters operate as intelligence gather-
ing agents who report directly to the Daidoji daimyō.
They monitor other clan representatives, infiltrate orga-
nizations, kidnap potential threats for interrogation,
and steal private documents—all to gather valuable
information on their opponents’ plans. A Daidoji Spy-
master moves about the court with as much charm as
any Doji Diplomat, but where the Doji form alliances
and curry favors, the Daidoji look for vulnerabilities.
