Yasuki Yōjimbō School [Bushi]
Skillful and cunning warriors, the Yasuki Yōjimbō pro-
tect people traveling to, from, or within the Crab lands
and escort caravans and shipments bringing vital sup-
plies to the front lines. These skilled bodyguards travel
alongside Yasuki Merchants and other courtiers across
Rokugan. To combat any threat to their charges, the
Yasuki Yōjimbō employ keen awareness and strong
knowledge of the terrain they travel through. If a sit-
uation looks untenable, these warriors prioritize the
safety of those under their watchful eye, cleverly using
the terrain to lose pursuers or force groups of enemies
to face them one at a time.

The Standing Death (Mastery Ability): Once
per game session, when you perform the
Challenge action (see page 263 of the core
rulebook), you may choose up to 6 additional
characters who can hear you as targets.
These targets must have status lower than or
equal to your original target's. If you succeed,
each target must fight you in a clash one at
a time in an order of their choosing (or flee
the battle). Each clash lasts one round. After
each clash, you regain fatigue equal to your
Earth Ring. Until all of these clashes have
concluded (or you have been killed), none of
your targets can perform Attack or Scheme
actions outside of their individual clashes.
