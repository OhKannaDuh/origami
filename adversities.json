LOSING YOUR HUMANITY A character with one or more instances of the Shadowlands Taint disadvantage is a Tainted being, and is affected by any effect that specifies Tainted beings.

Some believe it to stem from insufficient faith, while others treat it more like a disease of the body. Far from the Kaiu Wall, many believe it to be the end of a samurai\u2019s ability to serve. In Crane lands, widespread knowledge that a character has contracted it can be disastrous to their social and political aspirations. In Crab lands, it is simply a fact of life for many warriors who face the monsters beyond the wall. The Kuni family brews and distributes jade petal tea for the afflicted, a special remedy that can slow the corruption\u2019s effects. Some among the Unicorn, having seen strange maladies in the wider world, have even studied it like a disease, that they might one day conquer it\u2014though these scholars have yet to show progress LIVING WITH THE TAINT Within Crab lands, the Taint is tragically common. The Kuni maintain a great ledger with all of the names of the Tainted. A character who approaches the Kuni to report themself must forfeit status until their status is 20, but they can continue to serve the Crab. Outside of Crab lands, it is very rare to contract the Taint, and there are no standards on how it is handled. Some lords might send a Tainted retainer to the Kuni, while others might dispose of the retainer or quietly cover up the whole matter.<\/p><ul><li>You are a Tainted being.
